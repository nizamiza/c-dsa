# Data Structures & Algorithms in C

Hey thereâ€”

It's Niza here. Recently I decided to come back to C and remember those fond university days of coding data structures and algorithms. I also got pretty tired of JavaScript and wanted to have a nice palate cleanser to this whole web dev ocean of nonsense. Just simple good old C code. Thus, I present you this simple repository with my implementations of common data structures and algorithms. Perhaps some student will benefit from this!
